import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/callout';

Every Electrical Engineering student begins their journey with two fundamental principles: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). These aren't just abstract theories; they are the practical tools you'll use to analyze everything from a simple flashlight to a complex power grid.

<Callout type="info">
  **Key Takeaway:** KCL deals with current at a node (a junction), while KVL deals with voltage in a closed loop.

### Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

KCL is based on the principle of conservation of charge. It states that:

> The algebraic sum of currents entering a node is zero.

In simpler terms, whatever current flows into a junction must flow out.

```javascript
// Example: If I1 and I2 flow in, and I3 flows out
const I1 = 2; // Amps
const I2 = 3; // Amps
const I3 = I1 + I2; // Must be 5 Amps
console.log(`Current leaving the node (I3) is ${I3}A`);
*Two more sample posts (`study-workflow.mdx`, `exam-prep.mdx`) would be created in a similar format.*
